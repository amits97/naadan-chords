## Naadan Chords
Source code for Naadan Chords - a platform for Guitarists : https://www.naadanchords.com

> This project is a `create-react-app` application which communicates with a [serverless](https://serverless.com/) backend. Powered by AWS Services and a [Puppeteer](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/puppeteer/) powered Prerenderer for SEO benefits.

At a high level, this is how the project is split:
* **Backend API** - Managed by serverless. Uses AWS Lambda over API Gateway to fetch data from DynamoDB.
* **Frontend React Application** - All React frontend assets (HTML, CSS and JS from your npm build command) on AWS S3. Served using CloudFront.
* **Middleware** - Lambda@Edge on CloudFront which contains logic to send crawlers to fully rendered HTML content served from a Lambda function which runs `Puppeteer` using a `Chromium` headless browser. There is a cache layer in DynamoDB for already rendered pages.
